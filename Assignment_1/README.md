In the folder test_cases we have some inputs and their expected output.

To run, just download the folder we're in and run something like this on your terminal:
	
	```python main.py < test_cases/case02.in```

In this case, you're gonna run for the input given in case02.in. You can compare this to the output expected in case02.out
